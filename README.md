# The-Wanderer
Wanderers keep balance and help other worlds to develop which is a great responsibility. But they do not choose this life. What if you were one of them?

Everybody dies sometime. But there are a few who are given a chance to become immortal – for the price of living for others. Those who accepted this offer become the Wanderers. They leave their home, their whole world to help other worlds with all the knowledge they possessed when they were still mortals. They just wander from world to world, as a savior but not as a friend, just stay for a time then leave, never finding a home, only new and new worlds in need of a hero.

One day, you find yourself in a corridor full of mirrors – of worlds – with a strange, woman-like creature who doesn't look like anyone from your world.
And, instead of your name or just „you”, she greets you as „Welcome, Wanderer”.

Do you accept the offer?
